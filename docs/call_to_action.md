# A Call to Action for Ideological Builders

We stand at a pivotal moment where technology and ideology intersect to create real change. Crypto-Luminism will not manifest on its own – it requires the active participation of builders, thinkers, and community members across the ideological spectrum. Whether you've identified with the crypto-capitalist camp or the crypto-communist camp, the truth is we need both mindsets and skill sets to build this future. This is a call to unite in action:
Implement Crypto-Luminist Governance in Your Project: Take concrete steps to apply the principles described here. If you run a DAO or protocol, start experimenting with quadratic voting for your governance decisions. Or set up a quadratic funding round from your treasury to support community initiatives. If you're building a dApp, consider how you can involve your user community in decisions or profit-sharing in a decentralized way. Don't wait for others to set the example – be the example. Even a small trial (like a QV poll on what feature to build next) can demonstrate the power of these mechanisms and inspire others.
Contribute to Decentralized Identity and Sybil Resistance Efforts: Without solving identity, our lofty goals of inclusive governance can fall apart. Lend your skills to projects like Proof of Humanity, BrightID, Gitcoin Passport, or Identrics. If you're technical, help improve their algorithms or integrate their APIs. If you're community-oriented, host verification meetups or spread the word to get more people verified. If you have capital, fund grants for novel proof-of-personhood solutions (for example, better biometric devices, or academic research on social verification). A credible decentralized identity layer will benefit everyone in the space – it's a public good worthy of your support.
Build Scalable Infrastructure and Use Layer-2 Solutions: Make Ethereum's scalability your ally, not your bottleneck. Move your dApp or DAO operations to Layer 2 networks to reduce costs for participants and enable greater throughput. By doing so, you're not only improving user experience, you're sending a message: we value broad participation and we're ready for growth. If you have the expertise, contribute to core scaling tech – perhaps by running a rollup node, developing cross-chain bridges, or optimizing smart contracts for gas efficiency. High-bandwidth governance needs high-performance tech, and builders bridging that gap are key to our success.
Prioritize Security and Privacy in Governance: As you implement these new governance forms, do so responsibly. Use audited contracts or seek audits. Encourage or require the use of hardware wallets for your DAO signers to prevent hacks. Experiment with privacy-preserving voting – for instance, use tools like Snapshot with Shutter or try out MACI for a community vote, giving your members the experience of a secret ballot. Show that we can have both transparency and privacy by integrating zero-knowledge solutions in your apps. For those more academically inclined, contribute to research on secure multiparty computation or zk-SNARK applications for voting and treasury management. We need continuous innovation to stay ahead of adversaries.
Embrace and Evangelize the Fork-and-Merge Philosophy: Culturally, encourage an attitude that options and adaptability are strengths, not threats. If you're a project leader, openly acknowledge that users forking your project is within their rights – it will earn trust. If you're a community member and you see dissatisfaction brewing, push for constructive solutions (like a sub-project) rather than toxic infighting. Act as a bridge-builder who can help merge good ideas from elsewhere into your own community's practices. And when you encounter stubborn maximalism or ideological dogma, gently remind folks that the beauty of this space is its pluralism. Persuade fellow builders to collaborate across ideological lines. Host cross-DAO workshops, write case studies on successful forks or governance experiments and share them widely. The more we treat this ecosystem as an interconnected whole with shared goals, the faster we all progress.
Focus on Public Goods and Shared Infrastructure: Align yourself and your project with the broader health of the ecosystem. This means contributing to public goods funding, either by donating, providing matching funds, or launching initiatives like DAO-to-DAO grant programs. It also means building with interoperability and openness in mind. When you create something useful, consider open-sourcing it or making it a protocol others can integrate, not a siloed product. Public goods aren't just altruism – they are the foundation on which everyone can build and innovate faster. If you're more financially driven, consider that funding public goods (like dev tools, education, base layer research) increases the value of the whole pie, including your slice. If you're more impact driven, use the efficient new tools at your disposal (like QF) to direct resources where they're needed most. And importantly, share the results: show the world that decentralized communities can produce and sustain public goods better than the old models.
Onboard and Educate New Participants: Crypto-Luminism needs a growing, global community of users and builders to succeed. Take it upon yourself to mentor newcomers – whether it's teaching a friend how to use a DAO voting interface, writing an explainer on quadratic funding in your native language, or organizing meetups around decentralized governance. Ideological builders should seek to break the echo chamber: if you're crypto-capitalist by background, try explaining to a social activist how these tools could empower their causes (mention things like community-owned platforms, transparent funding). If you're crypto-communist leaning, talk to an entrepreneur or developer about how these models can still reward individual initiative and create new markets (e.g., markets for public goods, new cooperative business models). By appealing to each other's values in constructive dialogue, we can attract talent and ideas from all sides. Every new brain that joins the effort improves our antifragility and creativity. Remember, there's no "us vs. them" if we succeed – we all stand to benefit from a more decentralized, fair, and innovative society.
Finally, let's set our sights on the long term. We are not just building financial products or social clubs – we are potentially building the governance systems that could guide digital communities of millions, maybe one day entire cities or networks of cities. The responsibility is huge, but so is the opportunity for impact. The ideological debates of the past – capitalism vs. communism – led to a lot of strife and stalemates. We have a chance to turn the page by demonstrating a model that transcends that dichotomy. Crypto-Luminism can be the "great forward leap" in governance that the internet age has been waiting for, but only if people like you help make it real. So, whether you write code, design user experiences, formulate economic models, or build communities – we call on you to contribute to this movement. Implement these ideas, critique them, improve them, and shout results from the rooftops. Be the bridge between camps, the solver of hard problems, the protector of the vision. Future generations might look back on this era as the time when we reinvented governance for the better – let's give them every reason to see it that way.
